# TODOS  
> Created using `generate-todo.js`

- custom.d.ts:61: make the versions object here its own auto-generated interface
- server/app.ts:18: make this recurse properly instead of putting the entire thread to sleep
- server/pokeapi.ts:107: build out a better way to emit when `getPokemonList` finishes and resolve that here
- server/pokeapi.ts:129: make this language agnostic and map all localizations for the name/ species/ entry keys
- server/__tests__/api.test.ts:3: simplify startup time so this can be lower
